# Build a CLI RPG game following the instructions from the course.
# Ask the player for their name.
# Display a message that greets them and introduces them to the game world.
# Present them with a choice between two doors.
# If they choose the left door, they'll see an empty room.
# If they choose the right door, then they encounter a dragon.
# In both cases, they have the option to return to the previous room or interact further.
# When in the seemingly empty room, they can choose to look around. If they do so, they will find a sword. They can choose to take it or leave it.
# When encountering the dragon, they have the choice to fight it.
# If they have the sword from the other room, then they will be able to defeat it and win the game.
# If they don't have the sword, then they will be eaten by the dragon and lose the game.


# Save the user input options you allow, e.g., in a set that you can check against when your user makes a choice.
# Create an inventory for your player, where they can add and remove items.
# Players should be able to collect items they find in rooms and add them to their inventory.
# If they lose a fight against the dragon, then they should lose their inventory items.
# Add more rooms to your game and allow your player to explore.
# Some rooms can be empty, others can contain items, and yet others can contain an opponent.
# Implement some logic that decides whether or not your player can beat the opponent depending on what items they have in their inventory
# Use the random module to add a multiplier to your battles, similar to a dice roll in a real game. This pseudo-random element can have an effect on whether your player wins or loses when battling an opponent.


# Collect the name from your player
# Check whether it meets the length requirements for the API call
# Ping the Uzby API to create a new random name for your player,
# using the length of their given name as input
# Inform the player about their in-game name
